# 3D Gesture Mobile Authentication Using Acceleration and Gyroscope Sensor

## Project Overview

This final year project explores the development and implementation of an innovative 3D gesture-based authentication system for mobile devices. By leveraging smartphone sensors such as accelerometers and gyroscopes, this system uses behavioral biometrics through 3D hand signatures to enhance mobile security.

## Key Objectives

- **Innovate a new authentication method:** Utilize dynamic 3D hand signatures for robust user authentication.
- **User Convenience and Security:** Balance security measures with user-friendly authentication processes.
- **Develop a Prototype:** Create a mobile application prototype on the iOS platform.

## Key Components

- **iOS Mobile App (SwiftUI):** For developing the mobile application prototype.
- **FastAPI Backend:** For developing the backend system

## Results

- **SoftDTW Algorithm:** Demonstrated high efficiency and accuracy in user authentication, ensuring low False Acceptance Rate (FAR) and False Rejection Rate (FRR) while maintaining quick processing times.
